* Pivot Tables :

A Pivot Table in Excel (or other tools like Power BI, Google Sheets) is a feature used to summarize, analyze, explore, and present large amounts of data quickly.

Instead of manually calculating totals, averages, or comparisons, you can drag and drop fields into rows, columns, values, and filters to generate insights.


Why Pivot Tables Are Useful?

1)Quick Summarization – You can get totals, averages, counts without writing formulas.
2)Flexible Analysis – Rearranging fields shows data from different perspectives.
3)Data Filtering & Grouping – Easily filter by categories, dates, or ranges.
